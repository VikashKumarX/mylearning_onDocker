# Docker Architecture
Docker Engine:- The Docker daemon called (dockerd) is the Docker engine which represents the server. The docker daemon and the clients can be run on the same or remote host, and they communicate through command line client binary, as well as a full RESTful API to interact with the daemon dockerd.
Docker Image :- Are the “source code” for our containers; we use them to build containers. They can have software pre-installed which speeds up deployment. They are portable, and we can use existing images or build our own.
Docker Registries:- The images we build in registries. There are public and private registries. The public registry called Docker hub, where you can also store images privately. Docker hub has millions of images, which you can start using now.
Docker Containers :- The container analogy is used because of the portability of the software we have running in our container. We can move it, in other words, “ship” the software, modify, manage, create or get rid of it, destroy it, just as cargo ships can do with real containers.In simple terms, an image is a template, and a container is a copy of that template. You can have multiple containers (copies) of the same image.
